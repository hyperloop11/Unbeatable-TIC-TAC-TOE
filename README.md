# unbeatable TIC-TAC-TOE
This is a GUI based TIC-TAC-Toe game, where player plays against an unbeatable AI. The computer uses the minimax algorithm, with alpha-beta pruning to compute the best possible move. Tic-tac-toe is a small game(255168 total possible games)and the computer can go through all the possible moves and compute the best winning strategy using the normal minimax algorithm, but alpha-beta pruning is a massive optimization which makes the computer check furthur cases only when a better move isin't already available. It drastically improves performance of the game.
